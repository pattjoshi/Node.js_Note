# What is Node js?
- Node.js is a javaScript runtime built on chrome's V8 javaScript engine.
- Node.js is a javaScript running on the server. 

# History of node.js ?
- In 2009 an idea came in the mind of Ryan Dahi that why not run javaScript outside browser, so he took V8 engine and embedded in a c++ program and called it Node.exe later on become Node.js .

# When to use NOde.js ?
- I/o Bound
- Data Streaming Applications
- Real time chat Applications

# Node js Reple (READ, Eval, Print & Loop)
- The REPL feature of Node is very useful in experimenting with Node.js codes and to debug javaScript codes.
- The Node. js Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) is an interactive shell that processes Node. js expressions. The shell reads JavaScript code the user enters, evaluates the result of interpreting the line of code, prints the result to the user, and loops until the user signals to quit

- Read - Reads user's input, parses the input into javaScript data-structure, and stores in memory.

- Eval - Takes and evaluates the data Structure.

- print - prints the result.

- Loops - Loops the above commend until the user presses ctrl-c twice.

# Some Node.js commend
```
.break    Sometimes you get stuck, this gets you out
.clear    Alias for .break
.editor   Enter editor mode
.exit     Exit the REPL
.help     Print this help message
.load     Load JS from a file into the REPL session
.save     Save all evaluated commands in this REPL session to
 a file

Press Ctrl+C to abort current expression, Ctrl+D to exit the 
REPL
```
*********
# Create file in Terminal
```
type nul >home.js
```
# What we can do in REPL

- JS Expression
- use veriables
- Multiline code / loops
- use (_) to get the last result
- we cand use editor mode

## Argument:- 
- function call kari kari value pass kale argument kahe san
## paramente:-
